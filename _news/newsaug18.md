## August release has some 'hot' updates!

*Monday , 20 August, 2018*

Regardless of the weather, the team have been pounding their keyboards and have created some hot updates. New this month:

- Improved support when you import projects that don't already have a Dockerfile.
- Additional error feedback for Microprofile projects to help diagnose problems with project setup.
- Improved application status detection in ICP.
- Ability to select from a list of branches during pipeline deployment creation.
- Updated to Theia version 0.3.13. So now you get a new minibrowser for displaying HTML files, and you can preview markdown files.

We also have a new look structure on our [documentation](documentation). We've improved the table of contents so its easier to use. If you are new to Microclimate, we've added more info about [using microclimate](usingmicroclimate), and more about the [user interface](projectlist). We've also enhanced our [troubleshooting](troubleshooting) so you can navigate quickly to any particular issue.

As ever, we encourage you to pick up this latest update. We continue to drop code into Microclimate to add more value and improve on the overall quality and development experience. We would also really like to hear from you about any key function you would like to see that we might have not delivered yet, so swing by our [Community](community) page and share your thoughts and ideas!
