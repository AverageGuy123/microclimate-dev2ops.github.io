# Microclimate deprecated

*November 1, 2019*

As was announced last year, we have made a significant pivot on our development tools strategy. We learned some lessons developing and delivering Microclimate, and while some of the key value propositions were on point, we felt we missed on how we enabled those solutions for developers. As a result, we moved away from the idea of an all encompassing web-like IDE, and enabled the same key functions through extensions into industry standard IDEs via Eclipse Codewind. Please visit our new home at <a href="https://codewind.dev/">codewind.dev</a> to see what new and exciting content we have delivered. Through Eclipse Codewind we will continue to enable developers with features that will help ease their journey to developing cloud-native applications. Below is the official deprecation announcement for Microclimate:

**Microclimate has officially been deprecated. The evolution of Microclimate will now be delivered via the open source project Eclipse Codewind. In addition to being it's own standalone open source project, Codewind is also integrated with other key open source technologies that make up the commercial product IBM Cloud Paks for Applications. IBM Cloud Pak for Applications is the next generation application development platform that helps developers design, develop, deploy and manage their cloud-native applications with speed and control.**

**On December 1st, 2019 the helm chart for Microclimate will no longer be supported and will be removed from IBM's public helm repository on github.com, which will in turn result in the chart no longer being displayed in the IBM Cloud Private catalog. This will not impact existing deployments of the helm chart.**
