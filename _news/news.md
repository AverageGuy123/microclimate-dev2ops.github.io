# March updates

## Microclimate 19.03

*Friday 15 March 2019*

#### The following list shows updates for the Microclimate 19.03 release:

- You can more easily create a template from a project by using the wizard, or manually. You can also now create a template from a public Git repository. For more information, see [Working with templates](workingwithtemplates).
- You can configure your Microclimate environment to use DevOps pipelines in an [offline environment](offlinemicroclimateusing), such as behind a firewall. The [generic Docker (Python and Go)](offlinemicroclimategenericdocker), [Java Liberty](offlinemicroclimateliberty), and [Node.js](offlinemicroclimatenode) project types have offline support.
- Improved installation error detection when installing into IBM Cloud Private. The installation process now checks security secrets that prevent Microclimate Portal from starting.
- Status of releases dynamically updated in the GUI. You can now see the release status after a deployment is created.


### Microclimate Developer Tools for Visual Studio Code
- A fix is applied for compatibility with Microclimate 19.03.
