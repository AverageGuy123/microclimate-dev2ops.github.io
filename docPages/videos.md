## Videos

Once we have updated videos, place this "Videos" page after "Tutorials and samples" in the table of contents. Add the videos to this page and add a link to the video from the page of written documentation.

So, for example, the performance testing video would appear on the "Videos" page. Then, the performance testing doc page would link to the performance testing video on the videos page.
