## May release live!

*Friday, May 25th, 2018*

These months are flying by, and as such so are our Microclimate releases. While this release might not have as many externally visible changes (aka shiny new things), we have done some significant work under the covers to shore up our foundation and prep things for future features.

That being said there are a few things we would like to call out with this release. We have improved on our IBM Cloud Private (ICP) integration story, and now apps that are deployed from Microclimate by way of our devops pipeline show up in the ICP dashboard. Also in our integration with Theia, we have dropped in a new feature that enables you to choose whether or not you want to see all your projects in the IDE (original behavior), or only the currently selected one. The choice can be made via the Preferences page.

As always, we encourage you to pick up this latest update. We continue to drop code into Microclimate to add more value and improve on the overall quality and development experience while using Microclimate. We also would love to hear from you about any key function you would like to see that we might have not delivered yet, so swing by our [Community](./community) page and share your ideas!
