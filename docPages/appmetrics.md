## What is Application Metrics?

Application Metrics instruments Java, Node.js, and Swift runtimes for performance monitoring and provides the monitoring data through an API. You can also visualize data with the Application Metrics Dashboard. For more information, see [Application Metrics on GitHub](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/appmetrics).

## Application Metrics types

Application Metrics is available in the language of your project.
* [Application Metrics for Java](https://developer.ibm.com/javasdk/application-metrics-java/)
* [Application Metrics for Node.js](https://developer.ibm.com/node/monitoring-post-mortem/application-metrics-node-js/)
* [Application Metrics for Swift](https://developer.ibm.com/swift/monitoring-diagnostics/application-metrics-for-swift/)

## Accessing Application Metrics

Click **App monitor** in the Microclimate project to access Application Metrics. Toggle between the **Dashboard** and **Summary** tabs.

## Enabling Application Metrics

If you import a project that does not include Application Metrics monitoring data associated with it, you can add Application Metrics by including the appropriate resource or performance monitoring application. For more information, see [RuntimeTools](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/).
