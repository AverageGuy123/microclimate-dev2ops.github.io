## The Microservices revolution
Teams are increasingly turning to continuous delivery, microservices, DevOps, and containers as the foundation for application architectures to enable faster innovation and business agility. As microservices architecture gain traction for developing and delivering the modern, lightweight and composable workloads across public, private, and hybrid application environments, enterprises are increasingly adopting new methods to achieve agility and stability with microservices.

Users benefit from the following microservices capabilities:
- Decomposing large applications into small pieces
- Providing loosely coupled, composable modules
- Enabling easily scalable development
- Improving fault isolation
- Developing and deploying each service independently
- Eliminating any long-term commitment to a technology

For those who want to maximize the pace and benefits of continuous delivery, Microclimate serves as the enabling technology for the entire software delivery lifecycle.

## The business benefits of using Microclimate

#### Service-oriented and scalable
Offers development tools that enable you to create applications using a service-oriented, scalable approach. The cloud-native application can capitalize on the benefits derived from a cloud platform, allowing your enterprise to easily add capacity and manage the cost of the service.

#### Unified development environment
Delivers the tools, flexibility and cross platform ability to help you improve application development. An open, cloud-based development environment can drive innovation and offer a faster, unified development experience.

#### Built using the latest standards
Provides productivity tools with cross platform, multiple runtime support that are lightweight, open and built using the latest standards.

#### End-to-end Docker deployment
Enables you to create microservices and automated builds in Docker from the beginning. Eliminate the need to recreate problems that only happen on one machine, or differences when switching to containers in production. The environment is also built using Docker, enabling you to run it locally or host it on the cloud platform for use over the web. You can bypass issues with local settings or installers for multiple tools.

#### Fast and flexible development
Enables you to generate microservices in Java, Node and Swift; edit and see your changes as you go. When coding is complete, you can check it in and the pipeline will automatically build and deploy to Kubernetes. Save time with application monitoring tools and an HTTP load-driver to start. Each is preinstalled and preconfigured, and you can add more tools as needed.

#### Multiple IDE options
Includes Theia IDE in the box. Microclimate can also leverage popular IDEs including Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, Orion, and Atom IDE, for more information, see [Setting up your own IDE to use with Microclimate](./setting-own-ide).

## IBM Cloud Private
IBM Cloud Private provides an integrated IaaS and PaaS environment that can be deployed on premises, behind firewalls, and managed and controlled by any user that the enterprise determines. For containerized applications, IBM Cloud Private offers a Kubernetes-based container orchestrator, a private image repository, along with security, event management, a management console, and monitoring frameworks.
