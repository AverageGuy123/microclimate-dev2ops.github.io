To create, build, and start a new project in your Microclimate workspace:

1. Click the **New project** button on the Welcome page. If you have already created or imported a project, in the Microclimate header, click **Projects**, and then click **New project**.
2. Select your language. Options available are Java, Node.js, and Swift.
3. Name your project in lowercase letters and numbers.
4. Depending on your choice of language, you are prompted for additional information, if required.
5. Click **Create**. This step creates, builds, and starts your project in your Microclimate workspace. Microclimate downloads everything it needs to build the project and this might take some time depending on the speed of your internet connection.  
6. Check the build status and application status of your new project. For more information, see [Checking the application and build statuses](./checkingstatuses).
