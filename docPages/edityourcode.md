You can use your own editor to edit and test your code. For more information, see [Setting up your own IDE to use with Microclimate](./settingownide). Or, you can use the Theia editor that is shipped with Microclimate by following these instructions.

You must first either [create](./creatingaproject) or [import](./importingaproject) a project. If you have created or imported a project, in the Microclimate header, click **Projects**, and then click the project name of the project you want to edit.

The project view appears. For more information, see [Managing projects](./managingprojects). Click the `Edit` button to edit your project.
