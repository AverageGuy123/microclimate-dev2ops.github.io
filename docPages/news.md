## Microclimate beta refresh now available

*Friday, February 16th, 2018*

We are trying to get into a bit of a rhythm here, so we've put out a refresh of our first Microclimate beta. While there may not be any big  features being delivered in this particular refresh, we did make some changes to improve our fit and finish, and dropped our overall container footprint significantly as well. Our plan is to incremementally add features and function, so look for further updates from us as we churn out drivers. Head on over to our [Getting Started](./gettingstarted) page for instructions on how to move to the new refresh. 

Remember, if you want to open up a bug or influence what enhancements you would like to see, please visit our [Community](./community) page to find different ways to interact with us. GitHub, Slack, or StackOverflow....we've got you covered!
