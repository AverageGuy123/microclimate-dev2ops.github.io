How sharp are your coding skills? Do you consider yourself a master strategist? Are you willing to bet your character's life on it?

Welcome to Rogue Cloud, our homage to the old school [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) games. We spared you the monochrome graphics, but kept to tradition by creating an open-world, turn based world crawler complete with a top-down 2D multiplayer experience. However unlike a traditional game, where you get the luxury of a controller, keyboard, or mouse, with Rogue Cloud, you are  writing code to ensure your character's success...and survival, in a dangerous world.

### Why Rogue Cloud?

We wanted to introduce you to some work we have been doing on [**Microclimate**, our new Docker-ized end-to-end development environment](https://microclimate-dev2ops.github.io/)...but we wanted you to have some fun doing it. So we created Rogue Cloud, a game that allows you to easily jump in to development of a websocket-based microservice running in a cloud. Access the source from within Theia, our web-based IDE. Edit, redeploy, and see how your character fares. Did they get taken out by monsters? Or worse yet, did you perish at the hands of a co-worker's character? Make a few tweaks, edit and redeploy again. Rinse and repeat. Remember, revenge is a dish best served CODE!

The game also allows us to showcase the work of a few of our friends. Rogue Cloud is built on [**Open Liberty**, the premier platform for building Java cloud-native applications and microservices](https://openliberty.io). Swing by their site to learn more about their amazing open source enterprise application server.

Additionally, Rogue Cloud is also designed to showcase the capabilities of Kubernetes-based [**IBM Cloud Private**](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/products/ibm-cloud-private/) and [**IBM Cloud Containers services**](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service).
