## Creating a new project

To create, build, and start a new project in your Microclimate workspace:

1. Click the **New project** button on the Welcome page. If you already created or imported a project, click **Projects** in the Microclimate header and then click **New project**.
2. Select your language. Options available are Java, Node.js, Go, Python, and Swift.
3. Name your project in lowercase letters and numbers.
4. Depending on your choice of language, you are prompted with additional project creation options.

Java supports project creation across a number of frameworks.  These frameworks are:
- [Lagom](https://developer.ibm.com/code/partners/reactive-platform/)
- [Microprofile](https://microprofile.io/)
- [Spring](https://spring.io/)

5. Click **Create**. This step creates, builds, and starts your project in your Microclimate workspace. Microclimate downloads everything it needs to build the project, and this might take some time depending on the speed of your internet connection.
6. Check the build status and application status of your new project. For more information, see [Checking the application and build statuses](checkingstatuses).
7. If your project requires additional configuration files or instructions for build, you might need to modify them. For more information, see [Post-import instructions](https://microclimate-dev2ops.github.io/importedprojects#post-import-instructions).
