## General text editors

Microclimate can also pick up application changes by using most of the general text editors.
1. Edit the source files under the root of the created project directory.
2. Save your changes. Microclimate auto-detects your changes and rebuilds and redeploys the updated app. Refresh your browser to see the results.
