Microclimate Developer Tools for Eclipse enables you to work on your Microclimate applications from within Eclipse. Note that this is applicable to a local installation of Microclimate; IBM Cloud Private is not supported.

Use the Eclipse IDE to make modifications to your application, see the application and build status, view the logs, and debug your application.  All Microclimate application types are supported by Microclimate Developer Tools for Eclipse but only Microprofile/Java EE, Spring, and Node.js applications can be debugged. The minimum version of Microclimate required by the tools is 18.12.

The Eclipse tools are [open source](https://github.com/microclimate-dev2ops/microclimate-eclipse-tools). You are encouraged to browse the code, open issues, and contribute.

To get started, see [Getting started with Microclimate Developer Tools](mdteclipsegettingstarted).
