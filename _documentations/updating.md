To update Microclimate:
1. Uninstall the previous version. For more information, see [Uninstalling Microclimate](uninstall).
2. Install the new version. For more information, see [Installing Microclimate locally](installlocally), or [Installing Microclimate in IBM Cloud Private](https://github.com/IBM/charts/blob/master/stable/ibm-microclimate/README.md).

Note: Uninstalling microclimate does not mean that you lose your existing projects. The projects remain in your microclimate-workspace directory.
