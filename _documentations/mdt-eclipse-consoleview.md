## Viewing the console output for a Microclimate project

From the **Console** view you can see your application logs.

1. If the Console view is not shown, open it as follows: **Window** > **Show View** > **Console**.
2. By default, the Console view displays the *Application Log*.
3. To change the log file displayed, click on the **Display Selected Console** menu and choose which log file to display. The choices include *Application Log* and *Build Log*.
