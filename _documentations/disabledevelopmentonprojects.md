Every active project in Microclimate has a number of resources allocated to it. If you have created a large number of projects, and want to save resources or avoid high CPU usage when you restart Microclimate, you can disable development on a specific project. Disabling project development means that the project will not be built until project development is re-enabled.

To disable project development on a project:
1. From the Projects page, click the project you want to disable.
2. Click **Disable project**.
3. Confirm that you want to disable the project.

To enable a project you have disabled, click the project, click **Enable project**, and then confirm that you want to enable the project. This restarts the application and build containers.
