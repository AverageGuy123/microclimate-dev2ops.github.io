## Setting up your own IDE to use with Microclimate

Microclimate includes the powerful Theia IDE in the box, with extended capabilities including some [language servers](http://langserver.org) in the image, including our very own [XML Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.XMLLanguageSupport).

If you do not want to use Theia, you can choose your own IDE including [Eclipse](settingownideeclipse), [Microclimate Developer Tools for Eclipse](mdteclipseoverview), [Visual Studio Code](settingownidevisualstudiocode), [IntelliJ IDEA](settingownideintellij), Orion, or Atom IDE. To Microclimate, using your own IDE is just the same as using Theia - File Watcher continues to monitor your files for changes.

**Note:** These options are applicable to a local installation of Microclimate only.
