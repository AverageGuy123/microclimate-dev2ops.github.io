## Deleting a Microclimate connection

Delete the Microclimate connection from the Eclipse preferences. If you still have linked projects associated with the connection, the links are deleted when the connection is deleted.

1. Navigate to **Window** > **Preferences** > **Microclimate** > **Microclimate Connections**.
2. Check to see if the connection you want to delete has any linked projects. If you want to remove the links for those projects and the connection, select the connection and click **Remove**.
